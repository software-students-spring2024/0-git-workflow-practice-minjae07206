## Interesting website related to software development

#### [Codingapple](https://codingapple.com/)

The website codingapple helps people to learn coding and build applications. These days, there are so many online classes that teach you how to code, but after trying out multiple resources, I believe that codingapple is one of the best resources that can teach you how to build applications. The instructor explains concepts in a very simple way, without using fancy vocabulary. He also does not just follow through the project, but he continues to suggest other projects that could branch off and encourages students to learn and practice on their own as well. The downside of the website is that the contents are all in Korean. Overall, I definitely suggest trying codingapple if you are struggling to learn a coding language or a framework.

I found the article about [Codingapple](https://codingapple.com/) to be quite intriguing. It's always valuable to discover resources that simplify the process of learning to code and building applications. The fact that the instructor explains concepts in a straightforward manner, without overwhelming jargon, is particularly appealing. 

Moreover, the emphasis on encouraging students to not only follow along with projects but also explore additional ones independently is a fantastic approach to fostering deeper understanding and practical skills. 


However the only drawback, as mentioned in the article, is that the content is primarily in Korean, which may limit accessibility for non-Korean speakers. Nevertheless, for those who are looking for a comprehensive and hands-on approach to learning coding languages and frameworks, Codingapple appears to be a noteworthy resource worth exploring.

I do agree that this website does seem to teach many different frameworks and languages, but it seems you must know Korean to be able to effectively learn from this site.

My initial impressions of codingapple is that it is a very well put together and well organized website that seems to have a well defined curriculum for courses that would interest new and learning developers. The curriculum focuses on practical application instead of longer lectures and each course has great reviews. Codingapple seems like a good resource for anyone interested in development who speaks the Korean language and has extra money to pay for the courses.
