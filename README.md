## Interesting website related to software development

#### [Codingapple](https://codingapple.com/)

The website codingapple helps people to learn coding and build applications. These days, there are so many online classes that teach you how to code, but after trying out multiple resources, I believe that codingapple is one of the best resources that can teach you how to build applications. The instructor explains concepts in a very simple way, without using fancy vocabulary. He also does not just follow through the project, but he continues to suggest other projects that could branch off and encourages students to learn and practice on their own as well. The downside of the website is that the contents are all in Korean. Overall, I definitely suggest trying codingapple if you are struggling to learn a coding language or a framework.

Comment by Noah Zhou: I do agree that this website does seem to teach many different frameworks and languages, but it seems you must know Korean to be able to effectively learn from this site.
Comment by Wei Luo: Software engineering technique could be difficult, simpler way to explain it is always appreciated. It is always a smart choice to learn from a simpler approach
